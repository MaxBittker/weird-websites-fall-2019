# Course Title

Phone-First Creativity

# Course Description

From image macro bricolage to cell-phone novels, beat-maker apps, and TikTok trends; the phones is the emerging site of not just media consumption, but for new forms of art making. It's time to take these tools seriously, and understand what the mobile touchscreen can offer to creatives.

We will document and discuss the existing landscape of touchscreen interfaces for creation. Understanding the strengths, implications, and limitations of mobile creative tools will then empower us to imagine and realize their future.

# What will student do?

This course is a dialog between exploring existing tools, and developing our own.

Students will collaboratively research a wide range of mobile creative tools, analyzing their design and sharing through making. We will compare these tools to their big-screen predecessors, reflecting on who and what they enable.

50% of class time will be directing these findings towards the design and implementation of new tools.

Students will develop a variety of phone-based creative interfaces, such as musical instruments, experimental text editors, meme-makers, and digital fashion creators.

Introductory familiarity with javascript, html, and css is required, but we will build skills in rich interaction, mobile-first design, and effective prototyping.

# How will the course be structured? How many weeks?

14 weeks -
I want to be flexible and responsive to the students regarding the pace and format, but in that time we will build a body of research on the landscape of mobile existing creative tools, develop theory and principles about this space, and apply those principles towards a set of functional and shareable prototypes. Students can expect to strengthen core skill-sets in UX design and rich multimedia interface implementation.
